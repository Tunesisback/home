Freedom can be seen as a measure of personal agency an individual enjoys within the framework of society. It would appear that Canadians enjoy a high degree of freedom since we place very few restrictions on personal rights. However, there there is a distinction between having theoretical freedoms and being able to exercise these freedoms in practice.

The core limiting factor for exercising our freedoms is the availability of free time. Freedoms can only be meaningful when we have a chance to exercise them. If we look at Maslow's hierarchy of needs, we can see that time must be allocated towards basic needs before it can be allocated to our self-fulfillment.

We meet these basic needs by doing work, and a typical Canadian works for at least forty hours a week in order to do so. Meanwhile, the income earned from a typical job is roughly equivalent to living costs spent on food, housing, and other necessities as evidenced by the fact that nearly half of Canadians are \[200 dollars or less away from not being able to pay their bills](https://globalnews.ca/news/3434447/over-half-of-canadians-are-200-or-less-away-from-not-being-able-to-pay-bills/).

An obvious question here is why people don't get better jobs that pay more. One problem is that forty hour week is the expected standard, so even if you got a higher paying job you would still be expected to put in the same amount of work as a lower paying job. You will get better compensation, but not to such an extent that you would be able to stop working.

Another problem is that better paying jobs often require higher education. Getting education requires having both time and finances in order to attain it. If a person is unable to create savings while they're expected to work full time, then higher education ends up being outside their reach.

However, even those of us who are lucky enough to obtain such education typically end up being saddled with debt in the process. According to Statistics Canada, roughly \[half of the graduates](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3710003601) from higher education institutions graduate with debt. Paradoxically, obtaining higher education can make the financial situation worse where instead of simply not having savings the individual now owes large sums of money to their education institution.

The pattern that we see here is that Canadians are expected to spend majority of their time doing work in order to meet their basic needs leaving little time to spend on their own interests. This is true regardless of the quality of work, or the level of education the person is able to obtain. This situation constitutes troubling results for the amount of effective freedom that Canadians enjoy.

There are several ways we could combat this problem. The number of hours in the standard work week is not a law of nature, but rather a social contract that can be renegotiated. Other countries already have a shorter work week than what we enjoy in Canada. France has a \[35 hour week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35-hour_workweek), and Finland is even \[considering a four day work week](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2020/01/08/finlands-prime-ministers-aspirational-goal-of-a-six-hour-four-day-workweek-will-this-ever-happen/#38eff06d3638). There is no reason why Canadians can't have a shorter work week as well.

Providing universal guaranteed income is another policy that Canadians should demand. Creating a stronger social safety net would dramatically lower the risk associated with switching careers, starting a businesses, or getting higher education. This would directly lead to increased freedoms for Canadians by creating more opportunities for self actualization.

It's time Canadians started thinking about freedom in practical terms of freedoms we are able to exercise, and these freedoms start with having the freedom to choose how we spend our time.
